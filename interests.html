        <p>
          Beyond my studies and technical work, this is where you get a glimpse 
          of who I am. This section offers a closer look at my personal interests 
          and the activities that influence how I work, stay motivated and grow outside of academics.

          <li>I am seeking a technically challenging role where I can combine hands-on 
            engineering, analytical problem-solving, and continuous learning. I thrive in 
            environments that value depth, precision, and long-term impact.</li>

            <h3>Horses</h3>
            <p class="muted">I started riding at a young age, and equestrian sports have played a 
              significant role in my life ever since. Through riding, I have learned responsibility, 
              patience and long-term commitmen. From caring for a horse to training, competing 
              and constantly developing both myself and the horse. I have competed in dressage, show jumping 
              and eventing, experiences that taught me focus, discipline, and how progress is built through 
              consistency and trust.</p>

            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p class="muted">My family means a great deal to me. I grew up surrounded by a 
              large, close-knit family. They have always been a source of support, guidance and stability. 
              In both good and challenging times, there is always someone to turn to, to talk things 
              through, get advice, or simply spend time together.</p>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p class="muted">I have always enjoyed staying active and moving in different ways. 
              Over the years, I have trained regularly and competed in both running and swimming. 
              As a student, I also held school records in long jump and high jump. Training has 
              always been a natural part of my life, not tied to performance goals, but as something 
              I enjoy and return to for energy.</p>

            <h3>Friends</h3>
            <p class="muted">My friends keep me grounded and balanced. They remind me not to disappear 
              too deeply into my own projects or studies, and they bring energy, perspective and 
              laughter into my life. Whether it's spontaneous plans, deep conversations, or having 
              a training partner, I am deeply grateful for the people I have around me.</p>

            <h3>Outdoors</h3>
            <p class="muted">I enjoy spending time outdoors and being close to nature, 
              whether it's hiking, camping, or longer trips outside. One of my most 
              memorable experiences was climbing Kebnekaise, Sweden's highest mountain. Being outside 
              helps me slow down, clear my head and I appreciate the simplicity.</p>

            <h3>Cooking and baking</h3>
            <p class="muted">Cooking and baking are creative outlets for me. I enjoy planning 
              menus for larger dinners, spending time prepping in the kitchen and being the one 
              who brings homemade food to gatherings. Whether it's baking for a girls night or 
              making homemade dumplings on a Wednesday evening simply because it tastes better, I 
              enjoy the process as much as the result.</p>
